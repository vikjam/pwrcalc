.. function:: twomeans(m1 = NULL, m2 = NULL, n1 = NULL, n2 = NULL, nratio = NULL, sd = NULL, sd1 = NULL, sd2 = NULL, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.80)

   Two-sample t-test power calculation

    :param m1: Mean of a group 1 (e.g., the control-group)
    :param m2: Mean of a group 2 (e.g., the experimental-group)
    :param n1: Number of obs. in group 1 (e.g., the control-group)
    :param n2: Number of obs. in group 2 (e.g., the control-group)
    :param nratio: Specify the ratio of group 1 to group 2.
    :param sd: Standard deviation of each group, i.e., sd = sd1 = sd2
    :param sd1: Standard deviation of a group 1 (e.g., the control-group)
    :param sd2: Standard deviation of a group 2 (e.g., the experimental-group)
    :param sig.level: significance level; default is sig.level = 0.05
    :param power: one minus the probability of type II error, default is power = 0.8
    :rtype: A power.htest object with results in a structured list

:Example:

.. code-block:: rconsole

    > twomeans(m1 = 12, m2 = 16, sd = 5)

         Two-sample t-test power calculation 

                 m1 = 12
                 m2 = 16
                 n1 = 25
                 n2 = 25
          sig.level = 0.05
              power = 0.8
        alternative = two.sided

    NOTE: 
    m1 and m2 are the means of group 1 and 2, respectively.
    n1 and n2 are the obs. of group 1 and 2, respectively.

clustered
---------

.. function:: clustered(unclustered, rho, obsclus = NULL, numclus = NULL))

   Power calculations in an experiment with group clusters

    :params unclustered: Results from twomeans not adjusting for clusters
    :params rho: Specifies the intraclass correlation coefficient
    :params obsclus: Number of observations in each cluster
    :params numclus: Maximum number of clusters
    :rtype: A power.htest object with results in a structured list

:Example:

.. code-block:: rconsole

    > twomeans(m1 = 12, m2 = 16, sd = 5) %>% clustered(obsclus = 10, rho = 0.3)

         Two-sample t-test power calculation 

                            m1 = 12
                            m2 = 16
               n1 (unadjusted) = 25
               n2 (unadjusted) = 25
                           rho = 0.3
           Average per cluster = 10
    minimum number of clusters = 19
                 n1 (adjusted) = 93
                 n2 (adjusted) = 93
                     sig.level = 0.05
                         power = 0.8
                   alternative = two.sided

    NOTE: m1 and m2 are the means of group 1 and 2, respectively.
    n1 and n2 are the obs. of group 1 and 2, respectively.
