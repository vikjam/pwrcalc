\title{Two-sample t-test power calculation}
\usage{
twomeans(m1 = NULL, m2 = NULL, n1 = NULL, n2 = NULL,
  nratio = NULL, sd = NULL, sd1 = NULL, sd2 = NULL,
  sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8)
}
\arguments{
\item{m1}{Mean of a group 1 (e.g., the control-group)}

\item{m2}{Mean of a group 2 (e.g., the experimental-group)}

\item{n1}{Number of obs. in group 1 (e.g., the control-group)}

\item{n2}{Number of obs. in group 2 (e.g., the control-group)}

\item{nratio}{Ratio of sample sizes, group 2 to group 1; default is nratio = 1, meaning equal group sizes}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation of each group, i.e., sd = sd1 = sd2}

\item{sd1}{Standard deviation of a group 1 (e.g., the control group)}

\item{sd2}{Standard deviation of a group 2 (e.g., the experimental group)}

\item{sig.level}{significance level; default is sig.level = 0.05}

\item{power}{one minus the probability of type II error; default is power = 0.8}
}
\value{
Returns an object with all the study parameters
